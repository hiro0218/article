# VS Code Docs Writing Guidelines

## Introduction

These are our VS Code documentation writing style guidelines.

## General Style Tips

- Get to the point fast.
- Talk like a person.
- Simpler is better.
- Be brief. Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word.

## Alerts

  - `[!NOTE]` Information the user should notice even if skimming.
  - `[!TIP]` Optional information to help a user be more successful.
  - `[!IMPORTANT]` Essential information required for user success.
  - `[!CAUTION]` Negative potential consequences of an action.
  - `[!WARNING]` Dangerous certain consequences of an action.
